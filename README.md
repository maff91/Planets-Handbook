## About

Simple cute application that provides with basic information on solar
system planets. Available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maff.planetshandbook&hl=en).

The app was developed for education purpose in order to test Kotlin+MVC
approach.

Special thanks to Christopher Jones whose artwork was used in the application design.
